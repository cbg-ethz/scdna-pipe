## About
Reproducible Python data analysis pipeline. Performs single-cell copy number variation calling by learning the underlying tumour evolution history by state-of-the art phylogenetic tree reconstruction method: SCICoNE.The pipeline is built using Python, Conda environment management system and the Snakemake workflow management system. The pipeline starts from the raw sequencing files and a settings file for parameter configurations. After running the data analysis, pipeline produces report and figures to inform the treatment decision of the cancer patient.


## Installing
1. Clone the repository
2. Install and update using `pip`:
  ```bash
  pip install -e .
  ```

## Running
1. Prepare the configuration file according to your analysis
2. Run `snakemake` with:
  ```bash
  snakemake --configfile your_config_file 
  ```
3. (Optional) Refer to https://snakemake.readthedocs.io to customise your `snakemake` for your environment

## Contributing
