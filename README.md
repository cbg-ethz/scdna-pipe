## About
Reproducible Python data analysis pipeline. Performs single-cell copy number variation calling by learning the underlying tumour evolution history by state-of-the art phylogenetic tree reconstruction method: SCICoNE.The pipeline is built using Python, Conda environment management system and the Snakemake workflow management system. The pipeline starts from the raw sequencing files and a settings file for parameter configurations. After running the data analysis, pipeline produces report and figures to inform the treatment decision of the cancer patient.
